            <h2>We love our selfies. But coming in at a close second is how much we love photographs of our pets.</h2>
            <p>Pet photography is one of the <em>fastest growing pet trends</em>. It takes our love for pet selfies and places it in the hands of professionals, like you. Pet parents want to see their <strong>beloved companions</strong> in the best light. My step-children are grown and live in another state and another country. So? I get Christmas photos taken with our dogs <strong>every year!</strong></p>
            <p>The best pet photographers <em><strong>love</strong></em> animals, have a great sense of <em>style</em>, and can handle pets to get the best results.  There is a lot of opportunity for revenue and income in the pet photography industry. Why not join with us and see your business grow?</p>
